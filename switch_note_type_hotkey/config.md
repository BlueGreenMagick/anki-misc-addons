##Switch note type hotkey

Go to 'Manage Note Types', click rename, and copy paste note type name here

You can add in more keys: Write `"<shortcut>": "<note type name>"` on a new line. (Note all of these lines except the last must have a comma at the end)

Because of the way Anki works, you can't remove keys from config. So if you don't want a `"Ctrl+Shift+1"` hotkey, change it to  `"Ctrl+Shift+1": "none"` with a comma if it is not on the last line.
